# marriott-ev-charging-map

This is a simple PHP script that fetches the Marriott EV locations from the public web page, parses them using XPath, and stores the name, address and geocoded locations into a Sqlite3 database.

If you want to use this on your own, you will need a Google Maps API key, but those are cheap and readily available.

I have stored the current database in this repository as well. I do not intend to update this frequently but the latest update will be pushed here. Thank you!
